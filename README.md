a React JS application based around cryptocurrencies.i use hooks such as useState and useEffect while using Axios to interact with the Coin Gecko API. also using React Router Dom v6 to have dynamic routes.i learn about useParams , DOMpurify,and navigating common issues when working with APIs in React.using grid and flex was so funny in this project :)

## install and Run 

For setting up React in our local system, the first step is to Install NodeJs and npm.

The next step is to install a tool called create-react-app using NPM. This tool is used to create react applications easily from our system.npm install `-g create-react-app`

### Creating a new react project

After create-react-app is installed, we can create our first react application using the following command. `create-react-app test-project`
